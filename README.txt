# Genetic algorithms for clustered VRP

## Introduction

Clustering method based on Genetic Algorithms is used in order to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem [1]. The solution combines two approaches: Clustering and Genetic Algorithm (GA) and consist on showing the optimum delivery routes of a set of vehicles when delivering a set of packages into their destination citiess.

1. Clustering: assignment of packages to vehicles using K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
2. Genetic Algorithm: optimizing each vehicle delivery route using a GA
3. Executing different experiments and visualizing the results obtained in order to compare them
